  * Snapshot of your current professional capacity  
  
    1. Current role
    2. Success metrics
    3. Recent achievement

  > I'm currently chasing my master degree at TUM, studying Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence of Informatics Department.  
  > And this semester I just joined in the Exploration team of WARR, whose objective is to develop a rover deployed on the surface of the moon.  
  > My primary contribution to the team is  
  > No. 1 Transferring the old design of certer terminal from Eagle to KiCAD  
  > A recent win I would like to share ...

  * Highlight key strengths and takeaways  

    1. Identify 2-3 attributes  
    2. Match your experiences to the attributes  
    3. Select 1 key moment  

   > As a C++ developer, I did a project on my own, which is about developing a webserver deployed on Linux. Since this requires a lot of develpment tools, such as Git and CMake. I took the initiative to read the documentation about these tools and get my hand dirty with them. After this project, I believe I can dive into any new platforms or tools needed for the job.

* Future  
  
  * Reinforce why you're a good fit for the role  

   > As someone who has been parctising C++ for the past year, I look forward to applying the concepts I have learned in my Robotics classes in real-life situations.  
   > This has further reinforced my interest in pursuing the embedded software developer as my internship.  
   > My passion, combined with my international background, make me a strong asset to the software team at AED.  

## What is your biggest weakness  

* Highlight a skill expected of someone more senior
* Give a concrete example  

> Sure, I would say my biggest weakness is that sometimes, I find it hard to address a speech in front of people, even lack of confidence when presenting my work.
> I rememebr when I debated for my bachelor thesis. Just imaging the scene of standing in front of professors and classmates made me really nervous.  
> So not only did I practice and memorize the entire thing, I also printed my work for professors as a pre-read to make things clear.  
> Thankfully, I received positive feedback from professors and got my degree.  
> Still I am not a confident speaker, but I can say I have found ways to relieve myself from the nerve. And I think in the long term, addressing a speech would be less and less a problem for me.  

## Why are you a good fit for this role  

1. What can you bring to the role? (50%)

    * Match a strength of yours to the job requirement  
    * Mention how the new role represents a new challenge for you
    * how to achieve further growth in that particular field
2. What do you want out of it? (30%)
3. What makes you unique? (20%)

## Why do you want to work here?

* Three implicit questions  
  1. Do you have a growth mindset
  2. How much research have you done
     * Focus more on the role, and less on the company
  3. How enthusiastic are you about the role

> Well, as you can see, if I were hired for this job, this is exactly my first job. After going to school day by day for like 17 years, I want to apply those learnings in a more practical way and face challenges, then overcome them with a bunch of people  
> In addition, I have watched the video about your winning of the innovation award of 2023, which left me a deep impression. With your products, people can lock and unlock their car as easily as unlocking their phone. That's amazing and cool!
> Regarding this position, I want to develop the same thing or even cooler with the whole team and bring my part to your side

## Where do you see yourself in 5 years?  

* Break the interval into two parts, namely specific one and broad one
* Focus on what you will be doing  
* Skills that you will develop
* Signal to the intreviewer that you will stay long

> During the start of my career, just like now, I understand that developers can work on a variety of projects across different areas.  
> So for the first 1-2 years, I really look forward to keeping an open and growing mind. And at the same time, I want to absort as much industry knowledge as I can - from my peers, from metors and from clients. Reversely, I will definitely be helping out on the development for anyone who might need to help, which I think is a great oppotunity for me to touch on even more industries.
> For the time after that, I really hope to specialize one technical area and expand my network and capabilities in that area.
> And maybe, if I have the chance, I also hope to share my experience with new intern developers, so called new me.
> And that's my preview about my 2 years.

## What are your greatest strengths

## Tell me about a time you failed

* Define failure in your own word
* Focus on one thing  
* End with learning rather than result  

> For me, I define failure as being a coward and thus not daring to begin because even now I stick to the belief that beginning is the half of success, I was one of the cowards.  
> In this particular instance, I had just registered for the Hackthon held at TUM three months ago. With the hope of being a geek, I stepped on this event. But the topics there seemed too way out of my grasp. Not only that, but some students there asked me to do a questionaire. When he finished documenting and asked me to type in my email address, I could see from his screem that I was ranked Star 3 out of 5 by him. At that time, I was lashed out and the only thing in my brain was getting out of this place right now.
> As a result, I took the latest bus to home. And I was really disappointed in myself because clearly I was not brave enough to face a new challenge and there was no excuse for my skills. I endded up documenting this experience in my github so that I am motivated to improve myself and try everything with courage and passion  
> My biggest takeaway from this experience is beginning costs nothing but your courage. I have since applied this to all my campaigns, including looking for internship.
